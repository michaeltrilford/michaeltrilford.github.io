# MUI

A lightweight UI component library built on native web standards. Use it with or without frameworks to build fast, accessible, and design-consistent web interfaces.

## Getting Started

To serve the project locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

> **Note**: Some browsers block custom elements and JavaScript modules when opened directly via `file://`. Running a local server ensures proper loading of modules and styles.
