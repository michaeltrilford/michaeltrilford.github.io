# MUI Create App

A lightweight starter template for building accessible, fast-loading interfaces using native web components and MUI-inspired styling. No frameworks or build tools required — just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Zero Dependencies**  
  No need for React, Vue, or complex JavaScript tooling.

- **Accessible by Default**  
  Components follow inclusive design principles and semantic HTML standards.

- **Themeable Architecture**  
  Customise styles using design tokens and native CSS variables.

- **Modular and Flexible**  
  Use only the components you need. All elements work independently and are designed for progressive enhancement.

- ⚠️ **Note:** The component files in the `components/` folder are sample implementations only.
- You should replace these with components you intend to use in your project.
- Please refer to the latest component source code in the main [component library](#) as the included versions may be outdated.

🛠 Usage

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

Note: This step is required because some browsers block custom elements and module-based scripts when opened directly from the filesystem (file://). Running a local server ensures everything loads correctly.
